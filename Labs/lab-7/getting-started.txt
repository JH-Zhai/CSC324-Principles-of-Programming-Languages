This lab gets you started with using Haskell.  Haskell will be covered and used
in the remaining weeks of the course for topics better discussed under Haskell.

The accompanied file racket-haskell.txt shows a syntactic correspondence from
Racket to Haskell to get you started.

The code file FixMe.hs is a simple piece of Haskell code, but it contains both
syntax errors and bugs.  Your job is to find out what they are and fix them, so
in the process you get the hang of Haskell coding.

FixMe.hs is also available on the teaching labs as /u/trebla/FixMe.hs

The popular compiler and REPL for Haskell is GHC.  Its REPL is "ghci" ("i" for
"interactive").  This is available on the teaching lab computers, e.g., ssh to
teach.cs.toronto.edu, then:

```
$ ghci
GHCi, version 8.6.5: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude> 
```

If you get "Command 'ghci' not found", the full path is /local/bin/ghci

Normally you would not write code at the ghci prompt directly (can be done but
doesn't scale).  Use your favourite editor on the code file(s), then go to ghci
and use its ":load" command or ":reload", then test as you like. E.g.,

```
:load FixMe.hs
```

and later after you have edited FixMe.hs,

```
:reload
```



If you are interested in further details on Haskell, the
[Haskell Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell)
is a good start.  For this lab, the sections "variables and functions" and
"truth values" are more than enough.


If you are interested in installing GHC on your own computer:

* Linux x86-64: <https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/> and you will also need your
  Linux distro's GMP "development" package, e.g., on Ubuntu it's libgmp-dev.
  Please also carefully read and consider ghcup's messages.

* macOS: <https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/>.  Please also carefully read and
  consider ghcup's messages.

* Windows: Either Chocolatey or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

  * Chocolatey: [Install Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), and then
    `choco install ghc`

  * WSL: On Microsoft Store pick a version of Linux, e.g., Ubuntu.  Then act
    like you have Linux x86-64.
